                                Donna's cat rescue is a self funded non-profit rescue which has the aim to rescue and rehome unwanted cats and kittens. 
                                We have been on this mission ever since 1996 to help those in need, 
                                and spending countless hours and days to rehabilitate sick cats and kittens back to full health in order for them to be rehomed into their new forever home.
                            </p>
